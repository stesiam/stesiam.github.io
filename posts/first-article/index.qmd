## Hello, Quarto !

Finally, I built my website using Quarto. Currently the page is hosted via {{< fa brands github >}} [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## How it all started

My encounter with Statistics was rather accidental. The first time I sat the Panhellenic exams, I was admitted to the Department of Economics at the University of the Peloponnese. Although I liked the idea of studying Economics, moving to another city (Tripolis) would have meant a significant financial burden combined with a great deal of uncertainty, something that felt quite overwhelming for me at the time. For that reason, I decided to sit the Panhellenic exams again the following year. As far as I remember, I had listed Economics departments and Computer Science departments, followed by Statistics departments, first in the Attica region and then in the rest of Greece. Eventually, when the admission scores were announced, I found out that I had been accepted into the Department of Statistics and Insurance Science at the University of Piraeus. As a student in a Statistics department, I began to gain my first relevant exposure through my studies. During the first years of my degree, the focus was mainly on theory, covering areas such as Statistics, Probability Theory, Insurance, and Actuarial Science. In this way, I built my first solid theoretical foundations. However, I felt that something essential was missing, perhaps the most important skill for a statistician: the ability to give substance to theoretical knowledge and apply statistical techniques in practice. Unfortunately, the department placed very little emphasis on this aspect. Indicatively, the curriculum of my academic year included only two courses related to applied statistical methodology using statistical software: Excel and SPSS. The SPSS course was fairly good, but it was by no means aligned with the level of knowledge I wanted to acquire, nor did it reflect the contemporary needs of the job market. Moreover, SPSS as a software package has several drawbacks that make it a poor choice: you cannot easily customize your models, you do not fully see how the results are produced, and, of course, it is not free. During the period 2018-2019, I started looking for alternatives, as I had grown to truly dislike this particular software, or, more precisely, the fact that I had to pay for it. Among other options, I discovered software tools with a similar philosophy to SPSS but available for free, such as PSPP, JASP, and jamovi. Personally, I found the latter two to be particularly solid choices. In fact, I would strongly recommend JASP and jamovi to anyone who lacks programming skills while also having no access to SPSS. It was around that time that I discovered the existence of a programming language specifically designed for data analysis: R, also known as Rstats.

## From SPSS to R

The transition from a statistical software suite to a programming language can be quite a shocking change, especially when it is your first programming language. SPSS and its free alternatives accompanied me for a considerable period of time, however, what initially seemed to be their main advantage gradually turned into a limitation. These tools are primarily designed to allow individuals with basic statistical knowledge to perform their own analyses. As my studies progressed and I became familiar with more methodologies and techniques, I started to realize that such tools could only help me grow up to a certain point. They are undoubtedly useful, but they impose a boundary on how deeply the user is expected or allowed to think. Anything beyond that boundary is either ignored because it is considered too complex for the majority, or handled through reasonable assumptions based on the data, so that the average user does not need to engage with theory or hypothesis testing. This point differs from one application to another: some aim to be overly simple and do a few things well for everyday use. All of them, however, come with limitations. As I continued working with such software, I began to wonder: if I wanted to introduce additional parameters or apply a variation of a statistical test I had encountered in a recently published paper, what would I do? That was the moment I realized that, by continuing down this path, I would end up serving the tools rather than my actual purpose. My goal was clear: to become knowledgeable in my field, not in a specific program or a statistical software suite. This realization led me to make a major change. My relationship with R began in 2019 and was marked by several ups and downs. At first, it felt quite unfamiliar, and for the most part, I was using it in a rather mechanical way. In simple terms, I was copying code and trying to understand what I was doing. To be completely honest, if I wanted to check whether differences were statistically significant, I would simply look it up on Google. Due to its particular nature as a language, I initially treated R more as an analysis tool than as a programming language. My first uses of R involved basic statistical tests, and I was excited by the realization that I could now work with a tool offering theoretically unlimited possibilities compared to "out-of-the-box" software. The journey was demanding and involved many late nights, but after countless error messages, I began to notice my gradual improvement.

Packages to make a website in R (before Quarto)
:::

## Objectives

As this is my first article on my website, I would like to enumerate my goals for this website. So, on this website, I am planning to :

- Write ML Notebooks (using R and Python)
- Upload articles that will help other users (e.g., "How to make your Quarto site" etc.)
- Showcasing my projects (regarding Shiny Apps, courses, etc.)
- Write posts about R in Greek as there are not many R users in Greece
- Solving exam papers on my website.
- And many more ..., so stay tuned!
