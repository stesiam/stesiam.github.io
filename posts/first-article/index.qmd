## Hello, Quarto !

Finally, I built my website using Quarto. Currently the page is hosted via {{< fa brands github >}} [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## How it all started

As a Statistics undergraduate, I first began developing my interest in the field through my studies. During the early years of the program, we focused heavily on theory, covering topics such as Statistics, Probability, Insurance, and Actuarial Science. This allowed me to build solid theoretical foundations. However, what I felt was missing was the most essential skill for a statistician, the ability to give substance to theoretical knowledge and apply statistical techniques in practice. Unfortunately, the program placed very little emphasis on this aspect. In fact, in the curriculum of my year there were only two relevant courses, one based on Excel and the other on SPSS. The SPSS course was fairly good, but it was by no means aligned with the depth of knowledge I was seeking, nor did it reflect the modern demands of the job market. Moreover, SPSS as software has several significant drawbacks that make it a poor choice. These include limited flexibility in model customization, lack of transparency regarding how results are produced and of course, the fact that it is not free. During 2018–2019, I began searching for alternatives, as I had grown to strongly dislike the software—or more precisely, the idea of having to pay for it. Among other options, I came across free tools with a similar philosophy to SPSS, such as PSPP, JASP, and jamovi. Personally, I found the latter two to be particularly strong options. In fact, I would recommend JASP and jamovi as solid alternatives for individuals who lack programming experience and at the same time do not have access to SPSS. Around that time, I also discovered a programming language specifically focused on data analysis: R, which is often referred to as Rstats.

## Again and again

My relationship with R is starting 2019 with a lot of ups and downs. I can say that at first I found it quite strange and mostly used it quite procedurally. In short I was copying code and just trying to figure out what I was doing. That is, to expose myself even more, if I wanted to make a comparison if the differences were statistically significant I would Google it. Because of its specificity as a language I was using it more as an analysis tool than as a programming language. The first uses I had made of R were some simple statistical tests and I was excited that I could now use a tool with theoretically unlimited possibilities compared to "off-the-shelf" programs. Of course the whole journey was quite interesting with several all-nighters, but after countless error messages, I started to notice the gradual improvement.

It was a month ago, that I decided to start building my website. Initially, I was experimenting with other frameworks (e.g., [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the help of [blogdown](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/blogdown/), [Distill](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/)), which were pretty good, but Quarto fulfilled my needs. The reasons for my decision are going to be discussed in a new article.

Packages to make a website in R (before Quarto)
:::

## Objectives

As this is my first article on my website, I would like to enumerate my goals for this website. So, on this website, I am planning to :

- Write ML Notebooks (using R and Python)
- Upload articles that will help other users (e.g., "How to make your Quarto site" etc.)
- Showcasing my projects (regarding Shiny Apps, courses, etc.)
- Write posts about R in Greek as there are not many R users in Greece
- Solving exam papers on my website.
- And many more ..., so stay tuned!
