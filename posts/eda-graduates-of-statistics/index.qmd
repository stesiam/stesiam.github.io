## Introduction
::: {.callout-note}
Frequent updates should be expected until this note be erased.
:::

The recent study guide includes data about the graduates and their average grade of graduation over the years. First and foremost the data we are interested in are included in table form (which is good 😀) but it is part of a pdf file (which is not good 😢). Thankfully, **tabulizer** is the solution to this kind of problems, as it one of its various features is to extract tabular data from pdf files.

## Load Packages

As I will extract tables from a pdf file, I will definitely need `tabulizer` package. Unfortunately, I was not able to install the specific package, as I was getting an error similar to this
[one](https://github.com/ropensci/tabulizer/issues/157). This issue seems to be related to rJava package and [this
comment](https://github.com/s-u/rJava/issues/255#issuecomment-794473988) solved the issue. After installing `rJava`, I was able to install successfully tabulizer as below:

```{r}
#remotes::install_github(c("ropensci/tabulizerjars", "ropensci/tabulizer"))
```

```{r Import R libraries and fonts, warning=F, message=FALSE}

## Extract Data

The study guide gives a general description of the university, as well as the prerequisites for a degree and a detailed description of each course. In total, the guide is a little bit less than 200 pages! Of course we don't need My main source of data is the Department's study guide. The most recent one (2022) has data on admissions, graduations etc., since 2004. The study guide gives a
general description of the university, as well as the prerequisites for a degree and a detailed description of each course. In total, the guide is a little bit less than 200 pages! Of course we don't need everything in there. I am just interested on the tables of the last pages, so I will extract those pages first from the original pdf.

```{r}
# url = "https://www.unipi.gr/faculty/mbouts/anak/OS_22_23.pdf"
# 
# download.file(url, 
#               destfile = "sg22.pdf",
#               method = "wget",
#               extra = "--no-check-certificate")

pdf_subset('sg22.pdf',
  pages = 186:190,  output = "subset.pdf")

```

So, we extracted the pages which we are interested in. Let's take a look at
them:


Thankfully, tabulizer comes with a very handy function to extract all the tables from a PDF file. Yeap, I know the original study guide is written in greek but don't worry that's just to take a basic understanding of how the pdf and the tables look. I will translate the column names when I will work with the data. But look at the bright side. At least we will get a notebook with ggplot2
visualizations as an alternative of those Excel graphs :)

```{r}
statistics_tables <- extract_tables(
    file   = "subset.pdf", 
    method = "decide", 
    output = "tibble")
```

Extracting the tables from splitted PDF I get a list of 5 tables with my data. It's amazing that in a matter of seconds I get all the information in a format ready for analysis. If I were to write them the traditional way (copy-paste) it would definitely take me an hour.

## Admitted students

So, in Greece there is 1 standard way to be admitted to a university. Although there are 3 more ways which require some certain conditions. I will try to
explain them as simple as possible.

### Main Exams

Once a year, third-year high school students from all over Greece take exams on
the same subjects at the same time. The exams are known as **Panhellenic
Exams**. Until today, it's one of the few things in Greece that as its integrity
is not disputed, as the papers of students are getting graded by teachers from
other areas. However, it has also faced considerable criticism for the pressure
it places on students. In my opinion a fair one as everything in your life is
depending on these exams... If you fail you should wait to retake them next
year.

Typically the exams are being held between the second half of May and the first
week of June. The students' grades are getting published approximately either
the end of June or the first days of July. Then you are completing a list on
which you are declare which departments you are interested to. On the end of
July the minimum grades to be admitted for each department are announced. Those
can fluctuate significantly every year as they are depending on both students'
performance on the Exams and the difficulty of the exams.

In a nutchell, the departments from big cities like Attica (Athens, Piraeus) and
Thessaloniki have the biggest demand and so the minimum grades for those are
higher from the rest ones. For example, the Statistics Department in Piraeus had
a minimum grade of 11700 in 2019 (for simplicity consider it like 11.7/20). The
corresponding department of Statistics in University of Aegean the same year had
a minimum grade of 5100 (5.1/20) (yes, that's not a typo). Well there are many
reasons behind that, as the continuance of austerity in Greece, but in general
that's the pattern.

Not so fun fact but when I made my list of preference for studies, Statistics in
Piraeus was something like 15th place, so I guess my fate was that. Okay and a
little bit of anxiety. :)

### Transfer

As I wrote earlier there are some exceptions. First of all the Admission by
Transfer is referring to transfer your place in one department with one
**similar-study** in other city. There are many criteria mainly based on your
income. For example, a student admitted on Statistics on University of Aegean
could be admitted on Statistics Department on Piraeus (i.e. in case his/her
family hasn't enough income).

These seats are limited.

### Entry Exams

In case you have already graduated a Bachelor programme then you are able to
give Entry Exams on your department of choice, instead of the nightmare of
Panhellenic Exams.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
admitted_students = statistics_tables[[1]] %>%
  .[-1,] %>%
  setNames(c("Year", "Main_exams", "Transfer", "Entry_exams", "Other", "Total"))


admitted_students$Main_exams = admitted_students$Main_exams %>% as.integer()
admitted_students$Transfer= admitted_students$Transfer %>% as.integer()
admitted_students$Entry_exams = admitted_students$Entry_exams %>% as.integer()
admitted_students$Other = admitted_students$Other %>% as.integer()
admitted_students$Pct_Non_Main = (admitted_students$Main_exams/admitted_students$Total) %>% as.double()
rownames(admitted_students) = 1:nrow(admitted_students)



admitted_students = admitted_students %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = !Year, 
    names_to = "Admission_Type", 
    values_to = "count"
  )

admitted_students = admitted_students %>%
  dplyr::filter(Admission_Type == "Pct_Non_Main" &
                !(Year %in% c("2020-2121","2021-2022", "2022-2023"))) %>%
  mutate(perc = round((1 - count)*100, digits = 2),
         perc100 = 100-perc) %>%
  dplyr::select(c(-Admission_Type, -count)) %>%
  tidyr::pivot_longer(., cols = !Year,values_to = "Obs") %>%
  dplyr::rename(
    
  )

admitted_students %>%
  reactable(
    defaultPageSize = 5
  )
```

I would like to examine the percentage of students who have been admitted by the other 3 ways over the years.

## Online vs On-campus Exams

Due to pandemic COVID-19, Greek government suspended the operation of schools
(elementary, high school, universities) on Tuesday 10 March 2020. Some days
later imposed lockdown measures. That period our department organized online
lectures and organized online exams for the majority of the courses on Spring
Semester and on the September (retake exams). Long story short that lasted for
at least 2 years.

## Students Graduated in 6 Years

Last but not least, maybe the most nervewrecking statistic is that one. Just for
clarification, our studies have a duaration of four years. Although the majority
will not successfully finish their degree even in 6 Years. This is important as
currently has been voted the time-limit on BSc studies. We have 6 years to
complete our studies otherwise we will not take the degree. In the next years,
the best case scenario is that 60% of my collegeaus who were about to graduate
will not get their degree.
