# Introduction

[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) is one of the most well-known communities of
data analysts/scientists with over 10 million active users [@headsortails2022].
Besides that, Kaggle offers an abundance of functionalities (Notebooks),
information (through Discussions between users) and Competitions. It is worth
noting that there are other similar communities but they cannot compare to the
full functionality of Kaggle. For example,
[DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org/) could be considered an alternative for
participating in ML competitions, but it neither provides the possibility to
create notebooks nor has a large number of users.

:::

**Kaggle Machine Learning & Data Science Survey** is an annual survey conducted
by Kaggle. The platform asks its users to analyze users' data in the context of
a competition. In this notebook, I conduct an analysis based on 2021's survey in
order to compare Greek data analysts with the rest of the world.

# Prerequisites

## Import libraries

This notebook will definitely make some charts, so the ggplot2 package is
necessary. Also, having variables with too many values (e.g. country of each
Kaggle user) is an indication of using tables, and for this the reactablefmtr
package will help to get a nice result.

```{r Import R Libraries, message=FALSE, results='hide', echo=TRUE}
# General purpose R libraries
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(forcats)
library(gridExtra)
library(countrycode)

# Tables
library(kableExtra)
library(reactablefmtr)

# Graphs
library(ggplot2)
library(ggtext) # Add support for HTML/CSS on ggplot
library(showtext)
library(sysfonts) # System / Google fonts
library(glue)
library(ggflags)

# Other R packages
library(fontawesome)
#library(htmltools) # for building div/links

# Other settings
options(digits=4) # print only 4 decimals
options(warn = -1)

## Load fonts

# font_families_google() ## see list with available Google fonts

font_add_google(name = "Lilita One", family = "title", db_cache = F)
font_add_google(name = "Ysabeau Office", family = "subtitle", db_cache = F)

darksvglite <- function(file, width, height) {
  on.exit(reset_theme_settings())
  theme_set(theme_dark())
  ggsave(
    filename = file,
    dpi = 300,
    # height = 12,
    # width = 7,
    dev = "svg",
    bg = "transparent"
  )
}
```
## Import data

Using `read.csv()` from readr package, I import my dataset and I name it as
`kaggle_2021`. The dataset includes in the first line the question which is not
required for my data analysis, so I exclude it from my dataset.

```{r Import data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
kaggle_2021 = read_csv("data/kaggle_survey_2021.csv")

# Delete second line
kaggle_2021 = kaggle_2021[-c(1),]
```

## Prepare Data

Since my analysis is based on Greek users, I split the dataset into two parts.
One part includes exclusively Greek users and all the rest another. Thus, we can
observe any differences or similarities with broader Kaggle's userbase.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=F}
# Recoding Q2 variable

kaggle_2021$Q2 = kaggle_2021$Q2 %>%
  fct_recode(
    "Other" = "Nonbinary",
    "Other" = "Prefer not to say",
    "Other" = "Prefer to self-describe"
  )

## Recoding kaggle_2021$Q3

kaggle_2021$Q3 <- kaggle_2021$Q3 %>%
  fct_recode(
    "Hong Kong" = "Hong Kong (S.A.R.)",
    "Other" = "I do not wish to disclose my location",
    "Iran" = "Iran, Islamic Republic of...",
    "UAE" = "United Arab Emirates",
    "UK" = "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland",
    "USA" = "United States of America",
    "Vietnam" = "Viet Nam"
  )

## Recoding kaggle_2021$Q6
kaggle_2021$Q6 <- kaggle_2021$Q6 %>%
  fct_recode(
    "0 years" = "I have never written code"
  )

## Recoding kaggle_2021$Q4
kaggle_2021$Q4 <- kaggle_2021$Q4 %>%
  fct_recode(
    "Bachelor" = "Bachelor’s degree",
    "PhD" = "Doctoral degree",
    "Other" = "I prefer not to answer",
    "Master" = "Master’s degree",
    "No" = "No formal education past high school",
    "ProfDoc" = "Professional doctorate",
    "UniNoDegree" = "Some college/university study without earning a bachelor’s degree"
  )

kaggle_2021$Q4 <- kaggle_2021$Q4 %>%
  fct_relevel(
    "No", "UniNoDegree", "Bachelor", "Master", "PhD", "ProfDoc",
    "Other"
  )


kaggle_2021_compare = kaggle_2021 %>%
  mutate(Q3 = if_else(Q3 != "Greece", "Other", Q3))
```

# Kaggle's community

One of the first thing I observed when I signed up on Kaggle was the vast
majority of nationalities and the multicultural origin of the platform. Many
people from many countries all in one platform gathered sharing the same passion
for Data Science and Data Analytics. Something like Facebook but for Statistics
:)

Nevermind, I decided to make a `reactable` to see from which nationalities the
platform is comprised from. One out of four users are from India which makes
them the most populous nation in platform. By the way, Greek users are way less
making a 0.39% of Kaggle's userbase.

::: callout-note
## Assumptions Note

We should note that the results are from Kaggle's Survey. That is to say from
people that participated. An assumption has to be done that the distribution of
the users that participated is the same with the ones who didn't.

# Women participation in DS

Generally, women are under-represented in labor market. According to the World
Bank [-@worldbank2023], only one in two women participates in the labor market,
in contrast to men whose corresponding participation is 7 in 10. Does DS
community follow the same pattern? As it seems, **it varies**.

# Age Distribution

Greece's Kaggle Community it is comprised from more elerly people comapred to the rest of Kaggle's community. More specifically, Greece's most prevalent age group is 25-29 and a sufficient proportion of users on their 40s. On the contrary, Kaggle's community is quite youthy with most prevalent the three youngest age groups. Aggrevetating, those groups consist six out of ten userbase of Kaggle's community.
