## Εισαγωγή

Και ξεκινάμε...

Αυτό είναι το πρώτο άρθρο ανάλυσης στην ιστοσελίδα μου! Προσωπικά, δεν επιθυμούσα να ξεκινήσω με μία έτοιμη βάση δεδομένων και να εφαρμόσω ένα απλό μοντέλο μηχανικής μάθησης (ενδεχομένως να το κάνω σε ένα επόμενο άρθρο). Επομένως, αποφάσισα να παιδευτώ ελαφρώς πορκειμένου να κάνω και την εξόρηξη των δεδομένων σε συνδυασμό με την ανάλυση. Σε αυτό το άρθρο θα ήθελα να αναλύσω την So, I decided to make my own
with the help of [hellenic's parliament website](hellenicparliament.gr/).

The Greek political scene has particularly preoccupied global public opinion in
recent years, due to the Greek economic crisis. A part of it was spent on the
reasons that caused it. The causes of the Greek crisis are many and a point of
contention to this day. In this article we will deal essentially with one of the
points of criticism. The election of the same persons.

With this notebook I will try to analyze whether this claim is valid by counting
how many times someone has been elected to the Greek parliament. In addition, I
will study the obsession with the same persons at the party level, but also at
the local level (constituencies).

## Προαπαιτούμενα

### Εισαγωγή πακέτων

First and foremost, we have to load our libraries.

```{r Import R Libraries, message=FALSE, results='hide', echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# General purpose R libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra)
library(reactable)
library(highcharter)

# Graphs
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpol) 
library(ggtext)

# Other settings
options(digits=2) # print only 2 decimals
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::write_bib(.packages(), file = 'packages.bib')
```

### Εισαγωγή δεδομένων

After loading R libraries, then I will load my data.

```{r Import dataset, cache=TRUE, message=FALSE,results='hide',echo=TRUE}
parliament <- read_csv("data/greek_parliament.csv")
```

### Προεπισκόπηση δεδομένων

```{r Preview Data}
#| label: tbl-preview-dataset
#| tbl-cap: "Preview Dataset (first 6 rows)"

preview_dataset = head(parliament, 10)
kbl(preview_dataset, 
    align = 'c',
    booktabs = T,
    centering = T,
    valign = T) %>%
  kable_paper() %>%
  scroll_box(width = "600px", height = "250px")
```

### Δομή δεδομένων

|    Μεταβλητή    |           Τύπος μεταβλητής           |                 Περιγραφή                  |
|:----------------:|:----------------------:|:------------------------------------:|
|  `Full Name`   | *qualitative* <br> (nominal) | Surname and name of the member of parliament |
|    `Party`     | *qualitative* <br> (nominal) |    The party on which the MP got elected     |
| `Constituency` | *qualitative* <br> (nominal) |         MP got elected on this area          |
|     `Term`     | *qualitative* <br> (ordinal) |                 Plenum term                  |

Thus, my sample has `r ncol(parliament)` variables, of which 0 are quantitative
and 4 are quantitative properties, of which 3 are nominal and the rest one
(`Term`) is ordinal.

## Κωδικοποίηση μεταβλητών

Party names can vary from short to lengthy ones. The last ones are a problem for
our analysis because their names can not fit to our visualisations. The table
below is showing all the parties that have ever participated in parliament. Is
is apparent that some parties have really long names.

```{r}
data.frame(
  Party = unique(parliament$Party),
  Length = str_length(unique(parliament$Party))
) %>%
  arrange(-Length) %>%
  reactable(
    defaultPageSize = 5
  )
```

In our case the parties with the longest name is AN.EL. and Democratic Coalition
with 81 and 70 characters, respectively. On the contrary, the shortest party
name is POL.A. with 6 characters.

```{r}
## Recoding parliament$Party
parliament$Party[parliament$Party == "ANEXARTITOI DIMOKRATIKOI VOULEFTES"] <- "ADP"
parliament$Party[parliament$Party == "ANEXARTITOI ELLINES (Independent Hellenes)"] <- "ANEL"
parliament$Party[parliament$Party == "ANEXARTITOI ELLINES (Independent Hellenes) National Patriotic Democratic Alliance"]<- "ANEL"

```

## Χρώματα

A few days after, I decided that there should be a consistency in the choice of
colors. That's the reason of this section. Thus, I will assign a dedicated hex
color code to each party.

```{r}
parties = data.frame(
  Party = unique(parliament$Party)
) |>
  mutate(Color = case_when(
    Party == "PASOK" ~ "#95bb72",
    Party == "ND" ~ "#0492c2",
    Party == "KKE" ~ "#FF6666",
    Party == "SYRIZA" ~ "#e27bb1",
    Party == "KKE (interior)" ~ "#FF3366",
    Party == "INDEPENDENT" ~ "#ffffff",
    Party == "DIANA" ~ "orange",
    TRUE ~ "#808080"
  ))

kke_color = "#FF6666"
nd_color = "#0492c2"
pasok_color = "#95bb72"
syriza_color = "#e27bb1"
```

```{r}
names = c("Panhellenic Socialistic Mpvement", "New Democracy", "Communist Party of Greece", "Communist Party οf Greece (interior)",
          "Independent", "Coalition of the Radical Left", "Democratic Renewal", "Alternative Ecologists", "Political Spring",
          "Democratic Social Movement", "Popular Orthodox Rally", "Democratic Left", "Independent Greeks", "Golden Dawn", "Independent Democratic MPs",
          "Popular Unity", "The River")

parties$names = names

parties$Party_el= c("ΠΑΣΟΚ", "ΝΔ", "ΚΚΕ", "ΚΚΕ (εσωτερικού)", "Ανεξάρτητοι", "ΣΥΡΙΖΑ", "ΔΗΑΝΑ", "ΕΟ", "ΠΟΛΑΝ", "ΔΗΚΚΙ",
             "ΛΑΟΣ", "ΔΗΜΑΡ", "ΑΝΕΛ", "ΧΑ", "ΑΔΒ", "ΛΑΕ", "ΠΟΤΑΜΙ")

parties$names_el = c("Πανελλήνιο Σοσιαλιστικό Κίνημα", "Νέα Δημοκρατία", "Κομμουνιστικό Κόμμα Ελλάδας", 
                    "ΚΚΕ (εσωτερικού)","Ανεξάρτητοι", "Συνασπισμός Ριζοσπαστικής Αριστεράς", "Δημοκρατική Ανανέωση", 
                    "Εναλλακτικοί Οικολόγοι", "Πολιτική Άνοιξη",

## Σύνθέσεις βουλής

Now, I will make a short sum-up of the electoral resuts over the years. It is
important to share that I made it thanks to [this
post](https://datavizstory.com/a-parliament-diagram-in-r/) and `ggpol` package.
As I am planning to do this procedure for many electoral terms, I will convert
it as a function.

Arguments like `term` and `custom_title` are vital to create reproducible plots
for all the terms. Although a main problem is the colors. On the aforementioned
post it was about only one term. We knew how many parties we had, so we knew
what colors to set and how many. If we try that on many terms (on which the
number of parties can vary from 3 to 8) an error will come up which will say
"Hey, you have set 3 colors but I see that you have 8 values (parties)". This
was a real obstacle for me. After some tries and misses I came up with the
concept of **dynamic arguments**.

```{r}
make_parliament_plot <- function(term, custom_title, ...){

custom = parliament %>% filter(Term == term) %>% select(Party) %>% table() %>% t() %>% as.data.frame() %>%  `colnames<-`(c("","Party", "Seats"))

colors<-c(...)

custom$legend <- paste0(custom$Party," (", custom$Seats,")")

#draw a parliament diagram 
p<-ggplot(custom) + 
  geom_parliament(aes(seats =Seats, fill =  Party), color = "white") + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = colors , labels = custom$legend) +
  coord_fixed() + 
  theme_void()+
  labs(title  = custom_title,
       caption = "Source: stesiam | stesiam.github.io, 2022")+
  theme(title = element_text(size = 18),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5,size = 14,face = 'bold'),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        plot.caption = element_text(vjust = -3,hjust = 0.9, size = 8),    
        legend.position = 'bottom',
        legend.direction = "horizontal",
        legend.spacing.y = unit(0.1,"cm"),
        legend.spacing.x = unit(0.1,"cm"),
        legend.key.size = unit(0.8, 'lines'),
        legend.text = element_text(margin = margin(r = 1, unit = 'cm')),
        legend.text.align = 0)+
        guides(fill=guide_legend(nrow=3,byrow=TRUE,reverse = TRUE,title=NULL))

return(p)
}
```

::: callout-note
Note that till this moment I have not figure out how to change the position of
the parties in an efficient way (in a function) that will somehow represent
their potitical view. The next visualizations of the parliament are exclusively
about how many MPs got elected by each party.

::: callout-warning
As you can see on the next plot there are many MPs that are classified as
independent (according to Hellenic's Parliament website). Many of them are
members of parties "ANEL" and "Enosi Kentroon". However, a large wave of
departures from the parties led to not fulfilling the conditions to be
considered as parliamentary parties. For that reason members of these parties
(that did not left) are considered independent.

## Εκλεξιμότητα κόμματος

So far we have seen the most elected members of Greek parliament for the period
1981-2019. Ιt would be particularly interesting to study the same feature by
party. However, finding the most elected member per party can be challenging on
parties with relatively low representation on Greek parliament. That is the
reason for choosing only some of those.

Concerning the implementation part, I see that I will make some visualizations
with minimum changes (e.g., filter dataset based on party, change color, etc.)
so, the creation of a function is justified. That way, I will not repeat same
code, following one of the principles of programming (DRY - Don't Repeat
Yourself). On the following function we can see that I set 3 variables :

-   `Party` : I have to specify which data to filter
-   `color` : In order to customize color of my barplots to be similar to each
    party's color
-   `times_elected_min` : A argument that I added up later. The problem with its
    absence is that I have to deal with parties that elect for example 150 MPs
    and some others just 10. If I set a universal number of elections to
    visualize I will have diagrams with many problems. Let's suppose that I set
    a big value (e.g., 10). Then I would visualize my data for *ND* and *PASOK*,
    although parties with relatively low number of MPs would have only one or
    noone to show (*KKE* & *SYRIZA*, respectively). On the other hand if I set a
    low value I create a new problem as there will be many MPs of and it creates
    the need to edit many more things (like width of bars). An argument like
    `times_elected_min` can adapt the specific characteristics of each party.

```{r}
party_plot <- function(party, party_color, times_elected_min){
  party_df = parliament %>% filter(Party == party) %>%
  select(FullName) %>% table() %>% sort(decreasing = TRUE) %>% as.data.frame() %>% filter(Freq >= times_elected_min) %>% `colnames<-`(c("Full_Name", "Freq"))
  
ggplot(data = party_df, aes(x = reorder(Full_Name , Freq), y = Freq))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",width = 0.88, fill = party_color) +
  geom_text(aes(label=Freq), hjust = 1.5, vjust=0.5, color="white", size=4)+
  theme_minimal() +
   labs(title = "Most elected MPs",
       subtitle = "",
       caption = "Source: stesiam | stesiam.github.io, 2022",
       x = "Times elected",
       y = "Members of Parliament") +
  coord_flip()
}
```

The visualizations are presented in alphabetical order.

## Εκλεξιμότητα νομού

So far we have seen :

-   the composition of Greek Parliament
-   the most elected MPs on national level and
-   the most elected MPs on party level

The last part of my analysis will investigate the most popular MPs on local
level (per profecture).

Obviously, the same logic applies to party charts (same processes with minor
changes), so the use of a function is almost mandatory (over fifty -50- cases
!).

On my previous workflow I used table() function in order to take frequencies.
That's one easy way to go. Although I didn't figured out to add characteristics
from other columns (like party of the MP). Fir that reason I took the decision
to use count() instead of table.

```{r}
constituency_freqs <- function(input_constituency, min_times_elected){
cont_df = parliament %>% filter(Constituency == input_constituency) %>%
  count(FullName, Party) %>% filter(n >= min_times_elected) %>% as.data.frame()
  
  ggplot(data = cont_df, aes(x = reorder(FullName, n), y = n, fill = Party ))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",width = 0.88) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("ANEL" = "#bcd2e8", "INDEPENDENT" = "#cccccc","KKE"=kke_color,"ND" = nd_color, "PASOK" = pasok_color, "SYRIZA" = syriza_color,"XA" = "#000000")) +
  geom_text(aes(label=n), hjust = 1.5, vjust=0.5, color="white", size=4)+
  theme_minimal() +
   labs(title = "Most elected MPs",
       subtitle = "",
       caption = "Source: stesiam | stesiam.github.io, 2022") +
  coord_flip()
}
```

Now I have frequencies and the party for every MP. That will be useful on my
diagrams.
