My name is Stelios! I am a recent graduate of [Statistics and Insurance Department](https://www.unipi.gr/en/department-of-statistics-and-insurance-science/).
R is my go-to tool for my data analysis tasks. I have some hands-on experience, by writing
notebooks and developing some simple Shiny apps. I would like to further
enhance my knowledge - skills, concerning R, in a working environment.

### <i class="bi bi-briefcase"></i> PROJECTS {.section-title}

#### Scraping data 
<p class="small"><i class="bi bi-github"></i>  [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/stesiam/insuranceRegister)</p>

On this project I scrape the register of Insurance companies which is hosted on Bank of Greece's website. The dynamic nature of the table led to use a combination of rvest and RSelenium. On every page iteration I get the table data and on every row iteration I automate a click on every insurance companies' profile in order to scrape their address wherever it is provided.

#### Data Visualization
<p class="small"><i class="bi bi-github"></i>  [GitHub Repo](https://stesiam.com/gallery)</p>

For at least two years I have been practicing on data visualization using R and ggplot. Those years I have taken part to a lot of challenges such as [#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday), and [#30DayChartChallenge](https://github.com/30DayChartChallenge).

#### Data Analysis
<p class="small"><i class="bi bi-link-45deg"></i>  [Article URL](https://stesiam.com/posts/kaggle-greek-community/)</p>

An analysis based on Kaggle's recent survey (2022). My analysis focuses primarily on Greek users. Comparing them with the rest users of Kaggle, I came up with interesting facts as the comparatively low representation, significantly higher age and expeirience and lower representation of women in contrast to the average participation of women in Kaggle.

#### ML Web Applications
<p class="small"><i class="bi bi-globe"></i>  [Web App URL](https://stesiam.shinyapps.io/Dev-Wages-App/) </p>

Based on Greek Developers' Wages survey, I make the appropriate cleaning of data in order to build a regression (XGBoost) model with tidymodels. The app can predict the wage of a web developer based on some characteristics such as years of programming experience, employer's country,  etc. The accuracy of my model can be characterized mediocre due to the fact that the dataset is relatively small, as it is consisted of 800 participants. Light enhancements, concerning model's accuracy, have been observed in case of larger grids and combining models.


### <i class="bi bi-mortarboard"></i> EDUCATION {.section-title}
- **BSc. in Statistics and Insurance Science**<br>
<i class="bi bi-building"></i> [University of Piraeus](#)<br>
<i class="bi bi-calendar-check"></i> *Graduated at June, 2025*

<p>During my studies, I was taught several statistics-related courses and had some
exposure to statistical programs. Indicatively, <br>
- Probabilities<br>
- Statistics: Estimation Theory<br>
- Non-parametric Statistics<br>
- Sampling and <br>
- Statistical Programs using R <br>
are some of the most influential courses that helped me develop my knowledge
regarding Statistics.</p>
