# Hello, World !

Finally, I made my site using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and hosted it via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

It was a month ago, that I decided to start building my website. Initially, I was experimenting with other frameworks (e.g., [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the help of [blogdown](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/blogdown/), [Distill](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/)), which were pretty good, but Quarto fulfilled my needs. The reasons for my decision are going to be discussed in a new article.

Packages to make a website in R (before Quarto)

# Objectives

As this is my first article on my website, I would like to enumerate my goals for this website. So, on this website, I am planning to :

- Write ML Notebooks (using R and Python)
- Upload articles that will help other users (e.g., "How to make your Quarto site" etc.)
- Showcasing my projects (regarding Shiny Apps, courses, etc.)
- Write posts about R in Greek as there are not many R users in Greece
- Solving exam papers on my website.
- And many more ..., so stay tuned!
