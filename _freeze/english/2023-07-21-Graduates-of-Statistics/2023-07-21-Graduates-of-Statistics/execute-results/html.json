This is \n\nTHe recent study guide includes data about the graduates and their average grade of graduation over the years. First and foremost the data we are interested in are included in table form (which is good) but is is part of a pdf file (which is not good :)). Thankfully, **tabulizer** is the solution to this kind of problems.\n\n\n\n## Load Packages\n\nAs I will extract tables from a pdf file, I will definitely need **tabulizer** package. Unfortunately, I was not able to install the specific package, as I was getting an error similar to this [one](https://github.com/ropensci/tabulizer/issues/157). This issue seems to be related to rJava package and [this comment](https://github.com/s-u/rJava/issues/255#issuecomment-794473988) solved the issue. After installing rJava I was able to install successufully tabulizer as below:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# remotes::install_github(c(\"ropensci/tabulizerjars\", \"ropensci/tabulizer\"))\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tabulizer)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Extract Data\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nurl = \"https://www.unipi.gr/faculty/mbouts/anak/OS_22_23.pdf\"\ndestfile = \"english/2023-07-21-Graduates-of-Statistics\"\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndownload.file(url, destfile = './others/')\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning in download.file(url, destfile = \"./others/\"): URL\nhttps://www.unipi.gr/faculty/mbouts/anak/OS_22_23.pdf: cannot open destfile\n'./others/', reason 'Is a directory'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning in download.file(url, destfile = \"./others/\"): download had nonzero\nexit status\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Analysing Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Acknowledgements {.appendix .unlisted}\n\nDataset based on recent study guide <a href=\"https://www.unipi.gr/faculty/mbouts/anak/OS_22_23.pdf\">recent study guide</a> of Department of Statistics and Insurance Science of the University of Piraeus.\n\nImage by <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/users/vloveland-4834409/?utm_source=link-attribution&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=image&utm_content=2148715\">Victoria Loveland</a> from <a href=\"https://pixabay.com//?utm_source=link-attribution&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=image&utm_content=2148715\">Pixabay</a>\n\n\n## References {.appendix .unlisted}",
