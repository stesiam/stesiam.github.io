Initially, I was experimenting with other frameworks (e.g., [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the help of [blogdown](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/blogdown/), [Distill](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/)), which were pretty good, but Quarto fulfilled my needs. The reasons for my decision are going to be discussed in a new article.\n\n\n# Objectives\n\nAs this is my first article on my website, I would like to enumerate my goals for this website. So, on this website, I am planning to :\n\n- Write ML Notebooks (using R and Python)\n- Upload articles that will help other users (e.g., \"How to make your Quarto site\" etc.)\n- Showcasing my projects (regarding Shiny Apps, courses, etc.)\n- Write posts about R in Greek as there are not many R users in Greece\n- Solving exam papers on my website as Quarto gives the ability to include features of.\n- And many more ..., so stay tuned!\n\n## Last updated on {.appendix .unnumbered .unlisted}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"2023-07-06\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Acknowledgments {.appendix}\n\nImage by <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/users/rebeck96-819254/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=760358\">R.
