First and foremost the data we are interested in are included in table form (which is good ðŸ˜€) but it is part of a pdf file (which is not good ðŸ˜¢). Thankfully, **tabulizer** is the solution to this kind of problems, as it one of its various features is to extract tabular data from pdf files.\n\n## Load Packages\n\nAs I will extract tables from a pdf file, I will definitely need `tabulizer` package. Unfortunately, I was not able to install the specific package, as I was getting an error similar to this\n[one](https://github.com/ropensci/tabulizer/issues/157). This issue seems to be related to rJava package and [this\ncomment](https://github.com/s-u/rJava/issues/255#issuecomment-794473988) solved the issue. After installing `rJava`, I was able to install successfully tabulizer as below:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# remotes::install_github(c(\"ropensci/tabulizerjars\", \"ropensci/tabulizer\"))\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(glue)\nlibrary(showtext)\nlibrary(packcircles)\n#library(ggcirclepack)\nlibrary(sysfonts)\nlibrary(hrbrthemes)  #theme_ipsum_rs\n\nlibrary(reactable)\n\nlibrary(rJava)\nlibrary(tabulizer)\nlibrary(pdftools)\n\n\nfont_add_google(\"Lobster\", \"lobster\")\nfont_add_google(\"Lato\", \"economica\")\nfont_add_google(\"Creepster\", \"Creepster\")\nfont_add_google(\"Oswald\", \"Oswald\")\nfont_add_google(\"Ubuntu Condensed\", \"uc\")\n\nsysfonts::font_add('fb', '_extensions/quarto-ext/fontawesome/assets/webfonts/fa-brands-400.ttf')\nsysfonts::font_add('fs', '_extensions/quarto-ext/fontawesome/assets/webfonts/fa-solid-900.ttf')\n\nshowtext_auto()\nshowtext::showtext_opts(dpi = 300)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n## Extract Data\n\nThe study guide gives a general description of the university, as well as the prerequisites for a degree and a detailed description of each course. In total, the guide is a little bit less than 200 pages! Of course we don't need My main source of data is the Department's study guide. The most recent one (2022) has data on admissions, graduations etc., since 2004. The study guide gives a\ngeneral description of the university, as well as the prerequisites for a degree and a detailed description of each course. In total, the guide is a little bit less than 200 pages! Of course we don't need everything in there. I am just interested on the tables of the last pages, so I will extract those pages first from the original pdf.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# url = \"https://www.unipi.gr/faculty/mbouts/anak/OS_22_23.pdf\"\n# \n# download.file(url, \n#               destfile = \"sg22.pdf\",\n#               method = \"wget\",\n#               extra = \"--no-check-certificate\")\n\npdf_subset('sg22.pdf',\n  pages = 186:190,  output = \"subset.pdf\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"/home/stelios/stesiam.github.io/english-posts/2023-07-23-Graduates-of-Statistics/subset.pdf\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nSo, we extracted the pages which we are interested in. Let's take a look at\nthem:\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" src=\"./subset.pdf\">\n</iframe>\n```\n\n\n\nThankfully, tabulizer comes with a very handy function to extract all the tables from a PDF file. Yeap, I know the original study guide is written in greek but don't worry that's just to take a basic understanding of how the pdf and the tables look. I will translate the column names when I will work with the data. But look at the bright side. At least we will get a notebook with ggplot2\nvisualizations as an alternative of those Excel graphs :)\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstatistics_tables <- extract_tables(\n    file   = \"subset.pdf\", \n    method = \"decide\", \n    output = \"data.frame\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nExtracting the tables from splitted PDF I get a list of 5 tables with my data. It's amazing that in a matter of seconds I get all the information in a format ready for analysis. If I were to write them the traditional way (copy-paste) it would definitely take me an hour.\n\n## Admitted students\n\nSo, in Greece there is 1 standard way to be admitted to a university. Although there are 3 more ways which require some certain conditions. I will try to\nexplain them as simple as possible.\n\n### Main Exams\n\nOnce a year, third-year high school students from all over Greece take exams on\nthe same subjects at the same time. The exams are known as **Panhellenic\nExams**. Until today, it's one of the few things in Greece that as its integrity\nis not disputed, as the papers of students are getting graded by teachers from\nother areas. However, it has also faced considerable criticism for the pressure\nit places on students. In my opinion a fair one as everything in your life is\ndepending on these exams... If you fail you should wait to retake them next\nyear.\n\nTypically the exams are being held between the second half of May and the first\nweek of June. The students' grades are getting published approximately either\nthe end of June or the first days of July. Then you are completing a list on\nwhich you are declare which departments you are interested to. On the end of\nJuly the minimum grades to be admitted for each department are announced. Those\ncan fluctuate significantly every year as they are depending on both students'\nperformance on the Exams and the difficulty of the exams.\n\nIn a nutchell, the departments from big cities like Attica (Athens, Piraeus) and\nThessaloniki have the biggest demand and so the minimum grades for those are\nhigher from the rest ones. For example, the Statistics Department in Piraeus had\na minimum grade of 11700 in 2019 (for simplicity consider it like 11.7/20). The\ncorresponding department of Statistics in University of Aegean the same year had\na minimum grade of 5100 (5.1/20) (yes, that's not a typo). Well there are many\nreasons behind that, as the continuance of austerity in Greece, but in general\nthat's the pattern.\n\nNot so fun fact but when I made my list of preference for studies, Statistics in\nPiraeus was something like 15th place, so I guess my fate was that. Okay and a\nlittle bit of anxiety. :)\n\n### Transfer\n\nAs I wrote earlier there are some exceptions. First of all the Admission by\nTransfer is referring to transfer your place in one department with one\n**similar-study** in other city. There are many criteria mainly based on your\nincome. For example, a student admitted on Statistics on University of Aegean\ncould be admitted on Statistics Department on Piraeus (i.e. in case his/her\nfamily hasn't enough income).\n\nThese seats are limited.\n\n### Entry Exams\n\nIn case you have already graduated a Bachelor programme then you are able to\ngive Entry Exams on your department of choice, instead of the nightmare of\nPanhellenic Exams.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nadmitted_students = statistics_tables[[1]] %>%\n  .[-1,] %>%\n  setNames(c(\"Year\", \"Main_exams\", \"Transfer\", \"Entry_exams\", \"Other\", \"Total\"))\n\n\nadmitted_students$Main_exams = admitted_students$Main_exams %>% as.integer()\nadmitted_students$Transfer= admitted_students$Transfer %>% as.integer()\nadmitted_students$Entry_exams = admitted_students$Entry_exams %>% as.integer()\nadmitted_students$Other = admitted_students$Other %>% as.integer()\nadmitted_students$Pct_Non_Main = (admitted_students$Main_exams/admitted_students$Total) %>% as.double()\nrownames(admitted_students) = 1:nrow(admitted_students)\n\n\n\nadmitted_students = admitted_students %>% \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = !Year, \n    names_to = \"Admission_Type\", \n    values_to = \"count\"\n  )\n\nadmitted_students = admitted_students %>%\n  dplyr::filter(Admission_Type == \"Pct_Non_Main\" &\n                !(Year %in% c(\"2020-2121\",\"2021-2022\", \"2022-2023\"))) %>%\n  mutate(perc = round((1 - count)*100, digits = 2),\n         perc100 = 100-perc) %>%\n  dplyr::select(c(-Admission_Type, -count)) %>%\n  tidyr::pivot_longer(., cols = !Year,values_to = \"Obs\") %>%\n  dplyr::rename(\n    \n  )\n\nadmitted_students %>%\n  reactable(\n    defaultPageSize = 5\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"reactable html-widget html-fill-item\" id=\"htmlwidget-e8ab15d121bac9b7ad73\" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-e8ab15d121bac9b7ad73\">{\"x\":{\"tag\":{\"name\":\"Reactable\",\"attribs\":{\"data\":{\"Year\":[\"2003-2004\",\"2003-2004\",\"2004-2005\",\"2004-2005\",\"2005-2006\",\"2005-2006\",\"2006-2007\",\"2006-2007\",\"2007-2008\",\"2007-2008\",\"2008-2009\",\"2008-2009\",\"2009-2010\",\"2009-2010\",\"2010-2011\",\"2010-2011\",\"2011-2012\",\"2011-2012\",\"2012-2013\",\"2012-2013\",\"2013-2014\",\"2013-2014\",\"2014-2015\",\"2014-2015\",\"2015-2016\",\"2015-2016\",\"2016-2017\",\"2016-2017\",\"2017-2018\",\"2017-2018\",\"2018-2019\",\"2018-2019\",\"2019-2020\",\"2019-2020\"],\"name\":[\"perc\",\"perc100\",\"perc\",\"perc100\",\"perc\",\"perc100\",\"perc\",\"perc100\",\"perc\",\"perc100\",\"perc\",\"perc100\",\"perc\",\"perc100\",\"perc\",\"perc100\",\"perc\",\"perc100\",\"perc\",\"perc100\",\"perc\",\"perc100\",\"perc\",\"perc100\",\"perc\",\"perc100\",\"perc\",\"perc100\",\"perc\",\"perc100\",\"perc\",\"perc100\",\"perc\",\"perc100\"],\"Obs\":[15.28,84.72,17.35,82.65,13.08,86.92,16.59,83.41,23.87,76.13,32.81,67.19,30.33,69.67,30,70,1.49,98.51,13.08,86.92,25.45,74.55,19.49,80.51,13.82,86.18,13.82,86.18,17.06,82.94,8.25,91.75,21.92,78.08]},\"columns\":[{\"id\":\"Year\",\"name\":\"Year\",\"type\":\"character\"},{\"id\":\"name\",\"name\":\"name\",\"type\":\"character\"},{\"id\":\"Obs\",\"name\":\"Obs\",\"type\":\"numeric\"}],\"defaultPageSize\":5,\"dataKey\":\"d6ba351c17767cb1a57b17b789785898\"},\"children\":[]},\"class\":\"reactR_markup\"},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}</script>\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nI would like to examine the percentage of students who have been admitted by the other 3 ways over the years.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncaption_text = glue(\"<b> Data: </b> Study Guide of Statistics and Insurance Science <br><span style='font-family:fb;'  >&#xf09b;</span> <b>stesiam</b>, 2024\")\n\n\nggplot(data = admitted_students, aes(x = \"\", y = Obs, fill = name)) +\n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\", width=1) +\n  facet_wrap(~Year, nrow = 3) +\n  coord_polar(\"y\", start=0) +\n  \n  labs(\n    title = \"Proportion of Admissions through Panhellenic Exams\",\n    subtitle = glue(\"It seems that <span style = 'color:#619CFF; font-weight: bold'>Panhellenic Exams</span> is the prevalent way to be admitted to Statistics <br> Department.

Some days\nlater imposed lockdown measures. That period our department organized online\nlectures and organized online exams for the majority of the courses on Spring\nSemester and on the September (retake exams). Long story short that lasted for\nat least 2 years.\n\n## Students Graduated in 6 Years\n\nLast but not least, maybe the most nervewrecking statistic is that one. Just for\nclarification, our studies have a duaration of four years. Although the majority\nwill not successfully finish their degree even in 6 Years. This is important as\ncurrently has been voted the time-limit on BSc studies. We have 6 years to\ncomplete our studies otherwise we will not take the degree. In the next years,\nthe best case scenario is that 60% of my collegeaus who were about to graduate\nwill not get their degree.\n\n![](https://github.com/stesiam/30DayChartChallenge/blob/main/2024/day23/day23-2024-cc.png?raw=true)\n\n## Acknowledgements {.appendix .unlisted}\n\nDataset based on recent study guide\n<a href=\"https://www.unipi.gr/faculty/mbouts/anak/OS_22_23.pdf\">recent study\nguide</a> of Department of Statistics and Insurance Science of the University of\nPiraeus.\n\nImage by\n<a href=\"https://pixabay.com/users/vloveland-4834409/?utm_source=link-attribution&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=image&utm_content=2148715\">Victoria\nLoveland</a> from\n<a href=\"https://pixabay.com//?utm_source=link-attribution&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=image&utm_content=2148715\">Pixabay</a>",
