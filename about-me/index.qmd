## About this website

My first attempt at creating a website was in 2022, using [Distill](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/), a popular R package that makes it easy to build a simple website. As you might expect, it was widely used by those familiar with R. Around the same time, Quarto was released, and I switched to it a few months later. Since then, I’ve been using Quarto exclusively for my website.

One important addition worth mentioning is the babelquarto package, which enables the website to support two languages (Greek and English). Because of the bilingual setup, I needed to choose a font that supports both Greek and English characters so that switching languages wouldn’t affect the typography. That’s why I use [Gentium Plus](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Gentium+Plus) throughout the website.

During the first year of my website’s operation, I used the free domain provided by GitHub, which was *stesiam.github.io*. Some older content, especially in the gallery collection, still references this original domain in diagrams from 2022. In 2023, I decided to give the website a more professional identity by purchasing my current domain name. Since the beginning, the site has been hosted for free through GitHub Pages.
