## Introduction

When someone starts with Machine Learning he usually starts to build some simple models as logistic regression, naive Bayes, linear regression etc. And those alone are already enough for most use cases, as their simplicity is productivity-friendly and comes up with adequate accuracy. However, in enterprise level, accuracy can be important for a lot of reasons. Gradient Boosting Machines are some algorithms which outperform the aforementioned methods and are not complex enough to use them. Of course, before we build the model with (e.g. tidymodels) we have to install them.

Thus, on this article I gather all that information.

| Installation Guides | Source |
| :---: |   :---:    |
| LightGBM |  [Link](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/v3.3.2/Installation-Guide.html)  |
| CatBoost |  [Link](https://catboost.ai/en/docs/concepts/installation)  |
| XGBoost  |  [Link](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html)  |

## LightGBM

### Option 1. Install R Package

If you are reading this blog, the most possible scenario in that you are using R too. The most easy way to install the corresponding R package :

```{.r filename="R code"}
start_time_lightgbm <- Sys.time()
install.packages("lightgbm", repos = "https://cran.r-project.org")
end_time_lightgbm <- Sys.time()
```


### Option 2. CMAKE

The LightGBM [documentation](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation-Guide.html#linux) are referring to this method of installation. 

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
sudo apt install cmake
```

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
git clone --recursive https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM
cd LightGBM
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
```



## CatBoost

Their [realeases](https://github.com/catboost/catboost/releases).

```{.r filename="R code"}
install.packages("devtools")
```

On my occassion, when I tried to install `devtools` had an error status. According to my error status I had to add packages `libharfbuzz-dev` and `libfribidi-dev`. After that, my devtools installation completed without errors.

![](images/error_message_devtools_install.png) 

```{.r filename="R code"}
start_time_catboost <- Sys.time()
devtools::install_url("https://github.com/catboost/catboost/releases/download/v1.1.1/catboost-R-Linux-1.1.1.tgz"[, INSTALL_opts = c("--no-multiarch", "--no-test-load")])
end_time_catboost <- Sys.time()
```


## XGBoost


```{.r filename="R code"}
start_time_xgboost <- Sys.time()
install.packages("xgboost")
end_time_xgboost <- Sys.time()
```



## Summary 

| ML Model | Method |  Installation time |
| :---: | :---: | :---:    |
| LightGBM | R package  | 7.79 min.  |
| CatBoost | R package (w/o devtools)  | 2.1 min.  |
| XGBoost  | R package  |6.16 min. |
