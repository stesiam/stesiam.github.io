Initially, I was experimenting with other frameworks (e.g., Hugo with the help of blogdown, Distill), which were pretty good, but Quarto fulfilled my needs. The reasons for my decision are going to be discussed in a new article."

    "text": "GitHub supports natively Jekyll sites. In case someone wants to host a website by using a different framework has to create that file. So simple as that.\nIf you are working local you can use this command :\ncd path/to/project\ntouch .nojekyll\nNote : You do not need to write anything on your .nokekyll file.\n\nAnd here comes my main troubleshooting with Github Pages. As a new user I came up that Github gives an already named specified folder for output (named “docs”). On Quarto, when you render your website the default directory that includes all the parts of your website) is named “_site”.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuarto’s Logo\n\n\n\nIn order to solve that you can go to your quarto.yml file and specify under the project category, your output directory like this :\nproject:\n  type: website\n  output-dir: docs\nIf you are not sure you can always check my repository to see how I did it.\n\nAt this point you have done the most crucial part but there is a little bit more. Now, you have to render your website.\nAfter you have done that you can commit your changes like that :\ncd path/to/project\n\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Initial commit\"\nAnd push your changes to your repository on GitHub.\n\n\n\n\n\nGithub’s Logo\n\n\n\ngit push -u origin gh-pages\n\nLast step, to make your page working is to go to the settings of your website repository. \n\n\n\nAnd set docs as your output directory : \n\n\n\nNow, your project should be “GitHub Pages -ready”. If your site is not live, you should check if something else is set up wrongly or you are missing something. There is one article by Beatriz Milz, who explains the procedure of creating a Quarto website (Milz, 2022). Although, have in mind that the aforementioned article uses Netlify instead of GitHub Pages which is the main subject of this article."
