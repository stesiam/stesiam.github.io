    "text": "Inspiration\nA couple of years ago, I had the desire to create a portfolio website, and I tried out many options. Long story short, I ended up using Distill, and I really loved it because it offered a balance of simplicity and professionalism. Despite some minor issues with Distill (many of which are resolved by Quarto), I was extremely happy with the platform. However, I faced a challenge as I was not only an amateur R programmer but also lacked hands-on experience with HTML/CSS. Around the same time, I discovered a website that listed many Distill websites together. This compilation of websites provided several benefits for me:\n\n\n\n\n\nDistill logo\n\n\n\nUnderstand the limits of Distill package\nMotivation to look on others’ websites and take some inspiration\nEasy access to implemented features and their respective code\n\nIn 2022, Quarto was announced and the things on website publishing with R changed a little bit. Many users have already considered the change to the new framework (based on the Distill sites listing above). Some others may are hesitant due to the fact that Quarto is new or they are not interested to read long documentation. Thus, I believe that a listing of Quarto websites is needed to make the framework more accessible to newer users and speed the implementation of features for existing ones.\n\n\n\n\n\nblogdown logo"

    "text": "Multilingual Websites\nUnfortunately, Quarto does not natively support the creation of multilingual websites. This can pose a challenge for those who wish to present their content in their native language, particularly if it differs from English. Currently, the official solution offered by Quarto involves using project profiles, but this approach appears quite complex and is only briefly mentioned in the documentation with regard to this specific use case.\nIf you’re interested in ongoing developments related to multilingual support in Quarto, you can follow the discussion on this topic on the project’s GitHub page. As of now, Quarto does not provide a clear or officially supported way to build multilingual websites, e-books, and similar content.\nDespite the lack of native support, the babelquarto R package was created to address this problem and make building multilingual sites more feasible and user-friendly.Some websites have already integrated babelquarto into their workflow and now offer content in multiple languages - one of which is the site you are currently reading. A great example of a multilingual (babelquarto) website (japanese / english) is Joel Nitta’s."

    "text": "The Reason\nBeing an undergraduate student in a Statistics department, I started to get my first impulses through the school. In the first few years of school we dealt with a lot of theory regarding Statistics, Probability, Insurance and Actuarial Science. So I had got the first important foundations. Of course, I lacked the most important characteristic for a Statistician, to be able to give substance to the knowledge and to be able to apply the corresponding statistical techniques. The school paid very little attention to these with only two courses one in Excel and the other in SPSS. The SPSS course was good enough, but was in no way equivalent to the knowledge, nor did it meet the current needs of the job market. Apart from that SPSS as a software has several negative aspects that make it a pretty bad choice, among them that you cannot customize your model, you cannot see how the results are obtained and of course it is not free. In 2018 to 2019, I started looking for alternatives, as I completely loathed this particular program. Among others, I found similar software to SPSS, but free, such as PSPP, JASP and jamovi, where I personally found the last two quite remarkable, however they were not enough for me. Somewhere in there I discovered that there is a programming language that is focused on data analysis (Spoiler alert: It’s called R / Rstats)."

In short I was copying code and just trying to figure out what I was doing. That is, to expose myself even more, if I wanted to make a comparison if the differences were statistically significant I would Google it. Because of its specificity as a language I was using it more as an analysis tool than as a programming language. The first uses I had made of R were some simple statistical tests and I was excited that I could now use a tool with theoretically unlimited possibilities compared to “off-the-shelf” programs. Of course the whole journey was quite interesting with several all-nighters, but after countless error messages, I started to notice the gradual improvement.\nIt was a month ago, that I decided to start building my website. Initially, I was experimenting with other frameworks (e.g., Hugo with the help of blogdown, Distill), which were pretty good, but Quarto fulfilled my needs. The reasons for my decision are going to be discussed in a new article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Distill logo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Blogdown logo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Packages to make a website in R (before Quarto)"

The most recent one (2022) has data on admissions, graduations etc., since 2004. The study guide gives a general description of the university, as well as the prerequisites for a degree and a detailed description of each course. In total, the guide is a little bit less than 200 pages! Of course we don’t need everything in there.

    "text": "Admitted students\nSo, in Greece there is 1 standard way to be admitted to a university. Although there are 3 more ways which require some certain conditions. I will try to explain them as simple as possible.\nMain Exams\nOnce a year, third-year high school students from all over Greece take exams on the same subjects at the same time. The exams are known as Panhellenic Exams. Until today, it’s one of the few things in Greece that as its integrity is not disputed, as the papers of students are getting graded by teachers from other areas. However, it has also faced considerable criticism for the pressure it places on students. In my opinion a fair one as everything in your life is depending on these exams… If you fail you should wait to retake them next year.\nTypically the exams are being held between the second half of May and the first week of June. The students’ grades are getting published approximately either the end of June or the first days of July. Then you are completing a list on which you are declare which departments you are interested to. On the end of July the minimum grades to be admitted for each department are announced. Those can fluctuate significantly every year as they are depending on both students’ performance on the Exams and the difficulty of the exams.\nIn a nutchell, the departments from big cities like Attica (Athens, Piraeus) and Thessaloniki have the biggest demand and so the minimum grades for those are higher from the rest ones. For example, the Statistics Department in Piraeus had a minimum grade of 11700 in 2019 (for simplicity consider it like 11.7/20). The corresponding department of Statistics in University of Aegean the same year had a minimum grade of 5100 (5.1/20) (yes, that’s not a typo). Well there are many reasons behind that, as the continuance of austerity in Greece, but in general that’s the pattern.\nNot so fun fact but when I made my list of preference for studies, Statistics in Piraeus was something like 15th place, so I guess my fate was that. Okay and a little bit of anxiety. :)\nTransfer\nAs I wrote earlier there are some exceptions. First of all the Admission by Transfer is referring to transfer your place in one department with one similar-study in other city. There are many criteria mainly based on your income. For example, a student admitted on Statistics on University of Aegean could be admitted on Statistics Department on Piraeus (i.e. in case his/her family hasn’t enough income).\nThese seats are limited.\nEntry Exams\nIn case you have already graduated a Bachelor programme then you are able to give Entry Exams on your department of choice, instead of the nightmare of Panhellenic Exams.\n\nadmitted_students = statistics_tables[[1]] %&gt;%\n  .[-1,] %&gt;%\n  setNames(c(\"Year\", \"Main_exams\", \"Transfer\", \"Entry_exams\", \"Other\", \"Total\")) %&gt;%\n  tidyr::drop_na() %&gt;%\n  dplyr::filter(Transfer &gt;= 0) %&gt;%\n  select(-Total)\n\nI would like to examine the percentage of students who have been admitted by the other 3 ways over the years."

However it can be considered a subjective metric, which leads on a non consistent decision (someone may consider the second figure as stationary and some others not.\nThankfully, there are some statistical tests which can help us on our decisions. Some commonly used are :\n\n\nAugmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test\n\nPhillips- Perron (PP) test\n\nKwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) test\n\nZivot-Andrews (ZA) test\n\nBut an other problem arises. We are not in a fancy IDE with menus and checkboxes. We use R and its packages. There are many packages that have already write functions to study stationarity with the aforementioned tests. Some of them are:\n\ntseries\nurca\nCADFtest\n\nWe should carefully evaluate our choices, as these packages advertise similar functionality but differ significantly in the scope of their functions and, more importantly, in the level of flexibility they offer for handling time series characteristics. In short, the tseries package is the one I’m most familiar with, but it is also the most limited in terms of configurable parameters. Although many tutorials use this package, I found that I couldn’t set the number of lags for tests or specify characteristics like trends when applicable. On the other hand, the urca package addresses these limitations by allowing users to specify both the trend component and the number of lags in the respective tests. One minor drawback of urca, however, is that it only provides critical values, not p-values.\nSummary\n\nShow the codesummary_stationarity_results &lt;- data.frame(\n                             \"Type\" = c(\"levels\", \"Diff(GRC)\", \"Diff2(GRC)\"),\n                             \"ADF test\" = c(\"Non Stationary\", \"Stationary\", \"Stationary\"),\n                              \"PP test\" = c(\"Non Stationary\", \"Stationary\", \"Stationary\"),\n                             \"KPSS test\" =c(\"Non Stationary\", \"Non Stationary\", \"Stationary\")\n)\n\n\nsummary_stationarity_results  %&gt;% kbl() %&gt;% kable_styling() \n\n\n\nType\nADF.test\nPP.test\nKPSS.test\n\n\n\nlevels\nNon Stationary\nNon Stationary\nNon Stationary\n\n\nDiff(GRC)\nStationary\nStationary\nNon Stationary\n\n\nDiff2(GRC)\nStationary\nStationary\nStationary\n\n\n\n\n\nADF test\nOne of the most\n\nH_0 : \\text{The time series has a unit root} \\\\\nH_1 : \\text{The time series has not a unit root}\n Selecting the lags\n\nShow the codelibrary(vars)\n\nLoading required package: MASS\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'MASS'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:dplyr':\n\n    select\n\n\nLoading required package: strucchange\n\n\nLoading required package: zoo\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'zoo'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    as.Date, as.Date.numeric\n\n\nLoading required package: sandwich\n\n\nLoading required package: urca\n\n\nLoading required package: lmtest\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'lmtest'\n\n\nThe following object is masked _by_ '.GlobalEnv':\n\n    unemployment\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:highcharter':\n\n    unemployment\n\nShow the codeG = VARselect(grc_unemployment$Value, lag.max = 20, type = \"const\")\n\n\n\nShow the codeget_adf_results = function(variable){\n\n    # Ensure variable is numeric (e.g., a time series or numeric vector)\n    if (!is.numeric(variable)) {\n        stop(\"Input variable must be numeric.\")\n    }\n    \n    # Perform ADF tests\n    adf_orig = adf.test(variable)\n    adf_diff1 = adf.test(diff(variable, differences = 1))\n    adf_diff2 = adf.test(diff(variable, differences = 2))\n    \n    # Extract results\n    adf_table = data.frame(\n        \"Transformation\" = c(\"Level\", \"1st Difference\", \"2nd Difference\"),\n        \"Dickey-Fuller\" = c(\n            adf_orig$statistic[[\"Dickey-Fuller\"]],\n            adf_diff1$statistic[[\"Dickey-Fuller\"]],\n            adf_diff2$statistic[[\"Dickey-Fuller\"]]\n        ),\n        \"Lag Order\" = c(\n            adf_orig$parameter[[\"Lag order\"]],\n            adf_diff1$parameter[[\"Lag order\"]],\n            adf_diff2$parameter[[\"Lag order\"]]\n        ),\n        \"p-value\" = c(\n            adf_orig$p.value,\n            adf_diff1$p.value,\n            adf_diff2$p.value\n        )\n    ) %&gt;%\n        kbl(digits = 5) %&gt;%\n        kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)\n    \n    return(adf_table)\n}\n\n\n\nShow the codeget_adf_results(grc_unemployment$Value)\n\n\nAugmented Dickey-Fuller test results\n\nTransformation\nDickey.Fuller\nLag.Order\np.value\n\n\n\nLevel\n-0.93123\n6\n0.94846\n\n\n1st Difference\n-3.50738\n6\n0.04240\n\n\n2nd Difference\n-9.48682\n6\n0.01000\n\n\n\n\n\nΣυνεπώς, είναι προφανές από τα αποτελέσματα του στατιστικού ελέγχου Dickey Fuller ότι η χρονοσειρά μου δεν είναι στάσιμη.

No matter when this small miracle happens, I will be here doing what I love. Until recently, I was heavily focused on R, but since I need to find a job, I have started learning Python more systematically. During my studies, I completed many assignments using LaTeX, which is a tool similar to Word but mainly used for work with heavy mathematical and statistical notation. In addition, in my free time, I enjoy creating various visualizations, writing analysis articles, and building statistical web applications like dashboards and ML apps. Many of these can be found on my website.\nHappy reading!"

No matter when this small miracle happens, I will be here doing what I love. Until recently, I was heavily focused on R, but since I need to find a job, I have started learning Python more systematically. During my studies, I completed many assignments using LaTeX, which is a tool similar to Word but mainly used for work with heavy mathematical and statistical notation. In addition, in my free time, I enjoy creating various visualizations, writing analysis articles, and building statistical web applications like dashboards and ML apps. Many of these can be found on my website.\nHappy reading!"

Τη χρησιμοποιώ από το 2018 και η εξέλιξή μου και το επίπεδο άνεσης μου έχει βελτιωθεί σημαντικά. Αποτελεί μέχρι και σήμερα τη πρώτη μου επιλογή γλώσσας για προβλήματα ανάλυσης/οπτικοποιησης δεδομένων ή μηχανικής μάθησης. Επίσης, τον τελευταίο καιρό έχω αρχίσει να μαθαίνω  Python, μη μπορώντας να αγνοήσω την ουσιαστική της κυριαρχία στο πεδίο της επιστήμης δεδομένων κυρίως λόγω των εφαρμογών της στη βαθιά μάθηση. Έχω φτάσει σε ένα ικανοποιητικό επίπεδο αρκετά γρήγορα, αν και έχω πολλά να μάθω ακόμα. Ακόμα πιστεύω ότι η R είναι η ιδανικότερη γλώσσα για την ανάλυση δεδομένων και για τη μηχανική μάθηση. Πέρα από αυτά\n\n\nTools\nΌντας κυρίως ένας R προγραμματιστής τα κύρια πακέτα που θα χρησιμοποι είναι τα μεταπακέτα tidyverse και tidymodels. Συνεπικουρικά μπορεί να χρησιμοποιηθεί και κάποιο άλλο πακέτο αναλόγως την πολυπλοκότητα της εργασίας που έχω αναλάβει.\n\ntidyverse\ntidymodels\nmodeltime\nrvest"

    "text": "About this website\nMy first attempt at creating a website was in 2022, using Distill, a popular R package that makes it easy to build a simple website. As you might expect, it was widely used by those familiar with R. Around the same time, Quarto was released, and I switched to it a few months later. Since then, I’ve been using Quarto exclusively for my website.\nOne important addition worth mentioning is the babelquarto package, which enables the website to support two languages (Greek and English). Because of the bilingual setup, I needed to choose a font that supports both Greek and English characters so that switching languages wouldn’t affect the typography. That’s why I use Gentium Plus throughout the website.\nDuring the first year of my website’s operation, I used the free domain provided by GitHub, which was stesiam.github.io. Some older content, especially in the gallery collection, still references this original domain in diagrams from 2022. In 2023, I decided to give the website a more professional identity by purchasing my current domain name. Since the beginning, the site has been hosted for free through GitHub Pages."

Αυτή η εφαρμογή έχει ως στόχο να αναδείξει τον ρυθμό της γήρανσης ιστορικά, αλλά να μελετήσουμε και τις προβλέψεις."

Πολλές από αυτές μπορεί να μείνουν αδιάθετες λόγω χαμηλής ζήτησης. Αυτό το φαινόμενο παρατηρείται σε σχολές εκτός των αστικών κέντρων. Τα τελευταία χρόνια υπάρχει και ένας επιπρόσθετος λόγος μιας και έχει θεσμοθετηθεί η ελάχιστη βάση εισαγωγής (ΕΒΕ), η οποία αποτρέπει την βάση μιας σχολής να πέσει κάτω από έναν συγκεκριμένο βαθμό (π.χ. κάτω από 7 ή 13) και για αυτό παρατηρείται στο πρώτο διάγραμμα των βάσεων μία απότομη αύξηση στις σχολές του Αιγαίου και της Δυτικής Μακεδονίας. από την εφαρμογή της να δούμε και άλλες αδιάθετες θέσεις. Έτσι, ο αριθμός των εισακτέων μπορεί πλέον να διαφέρει σημαντικά όχι απλώς μεταξύ τμημάτων εντός και μεγάλων αστικών κέντρων (π.χ. Πανεπιστήμιο Αιγαίου, Πανεπιστήμιο Δυτικής Μακεδονίας - Γρεβενά), αλλά και ως προς τον διαθέσιμο αριθμό εισακτέων και των εγγεγραμμένων φοιτητών.\n\nyears &lt;- unique(tmimata_statistikis$Year)\n\n# Step 3: Prepare series data\nseries_data &lt;- tmimata_statistikis %&gt;%\n  group_by(University) %&gt;%\n  summarise(data = list(Theseis)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(name = University) %&gt;%\n  select(name, data) %&gt;%\n  list_parse()\n\n\nhighchart() %&gt;%\n    hc_chart(type = \"area\") %&gt;%\n    hc_title(text = \"Distribution of available places by Department\") %&gt;%\n    hc_subtitle(text = \"Το τμήμα Στατιστικής του Πειραιά είναι αυτό που προσέφερε περισσότερες θέσεις αναλογικά με τις συνολικά προσφερόμενες σε πανελλήνιο επίπεδο.

    "text": "Mapping Departments\nFinally, it would be interesting to practice my skills in creating maps with R. I usually use Shapefiles to have a base map (in this case, the boundaries of Greece) or a package to define them, such as the rnaturalearth accompanied by the rnaturalearthdata και rnaturalhires packages. This was my approach in the first version of my article. Fortunately, in the past period, I have made a great effort to transform my static plots into interactive ones using highcharter. That’s what I am also trying to do with maps, as the aforemntioned library offers relevant mapping tools. On our specific example, we need Greece’s boundaries which are available from the library (as are the boundaries of other countries).\n\nstudents_by_dept = undergrads_by_year |&gt;\n  dplyr::filter(stringr::str_detect(Dept, \"ΣΤΑΤΙΣΤΙΚΗ\")) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Short = c(\"UniPi\", \"AUEB\", \"Aegean\", \"Grevena\"))\n\n\nuni_coord = data.frame(\n  uni = c(\"UniPi\", \"Aegean\", \"AUEB\", \"UoWM\"),\n  unilong = c(\"University of Piraeus\", \"University of Aegean\",\n              \"Athens University of Economics and Business\",\n              \"University of Western Macedonia\"),\n  dept = c(\"Statistics and Insurance Science\", \"Statistics and Actuarial Science\",\n           \"Statistics\", \"Statistics\"),\n  long = c(23.6529793, 26.5664138,23.7300928, 21.4565181),\n  lat = c(37.77, 39.0851185, 38.1940201, 40.1197471),\n  img = c(\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/UNIPI_Emblem.png/250px-UNIPI_Emblem.png\", \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/df/Aegean_University_logo.gif\", \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/89/AUEB_EMBLEM.png/250px-AUEB_EMBLEM.png\",\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/UoWM.png/120px-UoWM.png\"),\n  established = c(1938, 1984, 1920, 2003),\n  dpt_est = c(1977,2000, 1989, 2019),\n  town = c(\"Piraeus\", \"Samos\", \"Athens\", \"Grevena\")\n)\n\nuni_coord$symbol &lt;- c(\n  \"url(https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/Map_marker_icon_%E2%80%93_Nicolas_Mollet_%E2%80%93_Pin.svg)\",\n  \"url(https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/Map_marker_icon_%E2%80%93_Nicolas_Mollet_%E2%80%93_Pin.svg)\",\n  \"url(https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/Map_marker_icon_%E2%80%93_Nicolas_Mollet_%E2%80%93_Pin.svg)\",\n  \"url(https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/Map_marker_icon_%E2%80%93_Nicolas_Mollet_%E2%80%93_Pin.svg)\"\n)\n\n# Load Greece Map\nhcmap(\"countries/gr/gr-all\", name = \"SA\") %&gt;%\nhc_add_series(\n  data = uni_coord,\n  type = \"mappoint\",\n  hcaes(lon = long, lat = lat, name = uni),\n  name = \"Departments\",\n  color = \"brown4\",\n  marker = list(\n    symbol = \"url(https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/5081/5081368.png)\",  # example map pin SVG\n    width = 20,\n    height = 20\n  )\n) %&gt;%\n  hc_title(text = \"&lt;b&gt;Statistics Departments of Greece&lt;/b&gt;\") %&gt;%\n  hc_subtitle(text = \"In Greece, there are a total of four public undergraduate statistics schools.

Το συγκεκριμένο τμήμα κατά τη γνώμη μου αδικείται από τη βάση που έχει. Αν είχα την επιλογή να διαλέξω δίχως να λάβω υπόψιν το οικονομικό κριτήριο (κόστος ενοικίου κτλ.) θα ήταν η πρώτη μου επιλογή. Βέβαια, αυτή η επιλογή όπως έγραψα και στην αρχή βασίζεται αποκλειστικά σε πράγματα που θα έβρισκα στο διαδίκτυο και απλά τα μάζεψα σε ένα άρθρο. Υπάρχουν και άλλα πράγματα που έχουν σημαντικότατο ρόλο, όπως οι διδάσκοντες, το επίπεδο μαθήματος, τήρηση κανονισμών, εγκαταστάσεις, προσβασιμότητα και άλλα που δυστυχώς θα τα μάθετε, όταν θα είναι πολύ αργά."

    "text": "On this article, I will make a ML model, in order to predict the costumers of a bank that are interested on having a term deposit. To achieve this goal I will use some Boosting algorithms (XGBoost and LightGBM). The data is from UCI website (Dua & Graff, 2017) and the dataset that I worked with is “Bank Marketing” (Moro, Cortez, & Rita, 2014).\nBut first let’s explain some things.\n\nWhat is a term deposit ?\n\nGenerally, we are saving our money in a bank account but we are promising to not withdraw them for a specific amount of time.\n\nAnd why someone to do that ?\n\nIt is apparent that term deposits have a major disadvantage over regular ones in terms of capital availability. Of course, people will not have motive to do that without anything in return. For that reason, the banks usually offer higher interest for that kind of accounts. For example, Piraeus Bank (a bank in Greece) offers double interest rate on term deposits compared to regular ones.\nSo, we can assume that there will be a serious interest for that product mostly on people with significant amount of savings (&gt;1000) and do not have large, extraordinary expenses (loan, kids, etc.)."

Concerning general purpose R libraries, I also used gridExtra in order to show ggplot items side to side.\nOn its basis this analysis is about to predict if someone is interested or not to have a term deposit. Thus, we need to build a ML model. The all-in-one solution package tidymodels is crucial to this. Although, there are some concerns about our data (imbalanced predicted value and our implementation of LightGBM. Thankfully, these are solved by bonsai and treesnip packages, respectively.\nFinally, the ggplot2 (Wickham et al., 2025) package was used to create some visualizations, as well as an auxiliary package, ggtext (R-ggtext?), for further formatting those.\n\nShow the codelibrary(readr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(forcats)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nlibrary(highcharter)\nlibrary(glue)\nlibrary(reactable)\n\n# Build ML models\n\nlibrary(tidymodels)\nlibrary(bonsai)\nlibrary(themis)"

This is on the one hand extremely simple, but on the other hand we are downloading a fixed version of the data and therefore if I want to update the data I have to download the data again."

    "section": "Just a use-case",
    "text": "Just a use-case\nBefore completing this article, I decided it would be helpful to provide an example. At the time of writing, there are 49 databases to choose from. To demonstrate the usefulness of the API, I will select a database that is updated fairly frequently. One such dataset is that of passengers travelling on ships.\n\nlibrary(httr)\nlibrary(jsonlite)\n\nI set the base url of my data. Given the fact that I am interested on sailing traffic I will use the respective endpoint:\n\nbase = \"https://data.gov.gr/api/v1/query/sailing_traffic\"\n\nAs the documentation points out, we need to set the date range we are interested in. It is worth noting that you cannot retrieve a large range with a single API call. Returning to the previous example, ship passenger traffic data starts in 2017 and goes up to the present day (2023). Let’s assume that we don’t mind that, and we want the data from the first four days of July in 2023.\n\ndate_from = \"2023-07-01\"\ndate_to = \"2023-07-04\"\n\nAPI_URL = paste0(base, \"?date_from=\", date_from, \"&\", \"date_to=\", date_to)\n\ncall = httr::GET(url = API_URL,\n    add_headers(`Authorization` = paste0('Token token_id')\n    )\n)\n\nWhere it refers to token_id, you should insert the token that was sent to you by data.gov.gr via email. So, after requesting the data through a GET request and waiting a bit, we receive a list with various pieces of information. What we are interested in is the data, so we look into the content category of the list. However, we notice that the information is in an unreadable format since it is in hexadecimal form.\n\ndata = base::rawToChar(call$content)\n\nUsing rawToChar converts the response into readable characters but I still need to convert my data to tabular format in order to begin with my analysis.\n\n#data = jsonlite::fromJSON(data, flatten = T)\n\nFinally, using the jsonlite package, I receive a data frame named as data which includes every destination, passenger/car count for the requested date."

I didn’t want to just take a ready-made dataset and apply a machine learning technique (I will do this in the next articles). So, I decided to make my own with the help of hellenic’s parliament website.\nThe Greek political scene has particularly preoccupied global public opinion in recent years, due to the Greek economic crisis. A part of it was spent on the reasons that caused it. The causes of the Greek crisis are many and a point of contention to this day. In this article we will deal essentially with one of the points of criticism. The election of the same persons.\nWith this notebook I will try to analyze whether this claim is valid by counting how many times someone has been elected to the Greek parliament. In addition, I will study the obsession with the same persons at the party level, but also at the local level (constituencies)."

In case you are in a hurry, the use of an alterantive (most familiar) IDE is justified.\n\n\nTerminal\n\ngit config --global core.editor \"editor_name\"\n\nMost notable is Visual Studio Code, which is the most popular IDE, according to recent Stackoveflow’s survey.\n\n\nEditor\nCommand\n\n\n\nAtom\ngit config –global core.editor “atom –wait”\n\n\nVisual Studio Code\ngit config –global core.editor “code –wait”\n\n\nDefault branch name to main\nIn October of 2020, GitHub announced that will change the default name of initial branch from master to main. \n\nThe default branch name for new repositories is now main. GitHub.blog - October 1,2020\n\nTherefore, it would be good to make this change in our local environment as well, as follows :\n\n\nTerminal\n\ngit config --global init.defaultBranch main\n\nMerge method\nOne change that is not exactly necessary but helps me is to change the defaults regarding merge. Let’s say that I want to add a new feature in my application. Most of the times I will make a branch on which I will start developing my new feature. When I implement this function and I’m ready to merge my changes into the main code there are two situations.\n1. There are commits to main branch \nThe predefined action is to merge. The branch is visible. Our setting has not any effect on this case.\n2. There are no commits to main branch\nThe predefined action of Git is to take the feature branch and paste it on the top of main branch. By making the setting above I am telling Git to keep the branch and react like the first case. The branch is visible again.\nWith simple words, I am forcing Git to keep branch, regardless of changes to main branch.\n\n\nTerminal\n\ngit config --global merge.ff false\n\nAuto-sign your commits\nIn a previous article we saw how to sign our commits as well as the reasons for doing so. In short, we made a PGP key which we added to our GitHub account. From that moment to sign my commits I had to write git commit -S -m \"something\", instead of git commit -m \"something\". Of course, that method is a little bit problematic. It is a little bit longer, little different in comparison to what I am used to type and most importantly I may forget some times to sign it manually. The last one happened to me A LOT. Thankfully, there is a way to be carefree about that anymore. I can set git config in a way that my commits will be signed automatically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIf you do not have already a GPG key, you can have a look in this guide in order to generate one. Also, depending your hosting platform for your code, you can link your GPG with your account : \n\n\nGitHub and GPG keys \n\n\nBitBucket and GPG keys \n\nGitLab and GPG keys\n\n\n\n\n\nTerminal\n\ngpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG\ngit config user.signingkey key_id\ngit config commit.gpgsign true\n\nCheck your settings\nMaking the above settings, we can have a summary of those with the corresponding command:\n\n\nTerminal\n\ngit config --list\n\nHere is the output on my machine :\n\n\nOutput of git-config command\n\nThe image above sums up the settings of Git. Although, each user has different needs and for that reason it would be good in case you want to learn more about git config to see their documentation page."
